Traffic_Insight_Project

The dataset provided (traffic.csv) contains web traffic data, referred to as "events," from several different pages, identified as "links," over a 7-day period. The dataset includes various categorical dimensions such as the geographic origin of the traffic and the content of the page (indicated by isrc). Your task is to use this data to derive meaningful insights and support your analysis with appropriate statistical methods

The objective of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of the web traffic data, specifically focusing on the volume and distribution of events, and to explore strategies for increasing the click-through rates (CTR) of the links. You will analyze the provided dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas and SciPy to answer the following questions

1. Total and Daily Pageview Events:

How many total pageview events did the links in the dataset receive during the entire period?
What is the average number of pageview events per day?

2. Analysis of Other Events:

What is the total count and distribution of other recorded events in the dataset?

3. Geographical Distribution:

Which countries contributed to the pageviews?

4 Click-Through Rate (CTR) Analysis:

What is the overall click-through rate (CTR) calculated as clicks/pageviews? How does the CTR vary across different links?

5. Correlation Analysis:

Is there a correlation between clicks and previews on a link? If so, is it statistically significant, and how strong is the effect? Perform tests for both potential linear relationships and categorical (binary) relationships between these variables.
